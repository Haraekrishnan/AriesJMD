Hello! I'm working on a Next.js application and I'm facing a persistent redirection issue for users with a "locked" status.

**The Problem:**

When a user with `status: 'locked'` logs in, they are supposed to be redirected to and remain on the `/status` page, which displays an "Account Locked" message. However, the application gets stuck in a "Redirecting..." loop and never shows the correct page.

The main redirection logic seems to be located in `src/app/(app)/layout.tsx`, but there might be conflicting logic in `src/app/status/page.tsx` or how the user state is managed in `src/contexts/app-provider.tsx`.

Could you please review the following files and provide a fix to ensure that a locked user is correctly and stably redirected to the `/status` page?

-   `src/app/(app)/layout.tsx`
-   `src/app/status/page.tsx`
-   `src/contexts/app-provider.tsx`
